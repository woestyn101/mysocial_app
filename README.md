# Social app

## Description

This project challenged me to use a mongodb database 
and interact with it using node.js and the mongoose package.

During this project I learned how to:

- create a mongodb database.
- make a connection with the database.
- create Models and Routes.
- use mongodb compass.
- use virtuals in mongoose.
- validate email address.
- use Insomnia to test the database.
- set up routes with express.
